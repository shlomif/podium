=head1 NAME

podium - a POD-based presentation and website builder

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    podium --config=config.yaml clean
    podium --config=config.yaml build

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl's POD format is great for building code-heavy presentations.
So this takes the POD and builds presentations with it.

=head1 TODO

There's a lot to do.  I'm just putting this up to have something
up.
